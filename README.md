# time-series-sales-forecasting
This project demonstrates a time-based sales forecasting pipeline using Python and Azure ML Studio. A Linear Regression model was trained using the number of days since the first record to capture the trend in sales over time. The model predicts future weekly sales for a 30-day period.
